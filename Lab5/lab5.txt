CPSC5330 -- Big Data Analytics

For this lab you will build your "search engine" that uses the TFIDF data produced by the 
document ingestion phase.

The application will be a Python program that implements a query/response loop with the 
user, prompting for a query string.   Upon receiving the query string, the application
computes the "relevance" of each document to the query string.  Relevance is defined in 
the document Lab5TFIDF.pdf.

The application prints the docID and the relevance score for the five most relevant documents,
or less than five if there fewer than five that have non-zero relevance.

The TFIDF values have been pre-loaded into a DynamoDB table HanksTFIDF.  Your application must
use this table.

Sample output below.
