CPSC5330 -- Big Data Analytics
Lab 6

No such thing as too much TFIDF!

For this lab you will build your "search engine" that uses the TFIDF data produced by the 
document ingestion phase.

You will do the ingestion phase only (except for extra credit), and will work on the small
version of the text corpora that appears in the Lab6 folder.

You will work in a single notebook.  The code in your notebook -- if run from beginning to end -- 
should display in the last two cells respectively the five records with the highest TFIDF values,
and the five records with the lowest TFIDF values.

You should leave the output in your notebook so I can look at it, but also make sure that the notebook
runs successfully if I do clear state and run all.

The repository contains a fully functional version of TFIDF we did in Hadoop streaming.  This is for 
your guidance and reference only.  Do not try to copy it exactly into the Spark framework, many details
will be different.  However, its high-level structure (the five steps) should give you ideas about how
to structure your RDDs -- for example, you could first work on an RDD that produces  ((doc_id, term), count), 
one that produces (doc_id term_count), one that produces (term, idf), then one that combines those to produce
((doc_id, term), tfidf).
 
================================================
Extra Credit!  (max 5 points)

Although we built our search service using the low-latency feature of DynamoDB, search and relevance
can be done in the Spark context as well.

Write a function relevance(query) that returns a list with the five highest scoring documents.
Something like this:

relevance('dead KING garden!', tfidf, docs)

[('bible_kjv', 37),
 ('carroll_alice', 34),
 ('blake_poems', 17),
 ('chesterton_brown', 16),
 ('milton_paradise', 11)]

You must use Spark for this.  For example, you are not allowed to download your entire TFIDF table
into memory then do the computation using normal Python.

Submit:
  1.  A Zip archive file containing two files
     a.  A notebook containing your solution both to the regular part of
         the lab, and to the extra credit if attempted.
     b.  A PDF file with
        (a) Your name
        (b) How much time did you spend on the lab
        (c) What were the challenging / difficult parts of the lab
	(d) Did you do the extra credit, and if so, is it fully working?
