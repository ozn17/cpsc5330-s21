CPSC5330 -- Spring 2021
Lab 4

================================================
1. Document processing using EMR

This lab will synthesize the Java Hadoop Wordcount program we wrote in Week1 with
document processing similar to what you did in the TF-IDF exercise in Lab3.

Your solution will use regular (non-streaming) Hadoop, and will run on EMR.

Your single MapReduce job will start with the document corpus,  stored in S3 here:
s3://cpsc5330s21/data-input/textcorpora/

The main change over simple WordCount for this exercise is to introduce the
idea of "stop words" -- these are common words like 'the' 'a' 'an' that in
search contexts are often omitted from document indexed because they tend to
take up space and not make search retrieval any better.   The file stopwords.txt
gives you a standard list of stopwords.  

Your output will be one record per document, tab separated, with these fields
1.  Document ID -- same as previous lab.  For example, 'austen-persuasion'
2.  The total number of tokens in the document, including stopwords. Token is defined same as previous lab:
       whitespace delimited, all characters except letters removed, all letters lower cased.
3.  The number of stopword tokens in the document.
4.  Of the non-stopword tokens
      a.  How many terms (unique tokens) are there
      a.  What is average token length
      b.  What is the longest token

Here is an example output record:
burgess-busterbrown	15864	10394	1234	0.18453546	selfrespecting

A ZIP archive containing	
(1) A PDF file with
  (a) Your name
  (b) How much time did you spend on the lab
  (c) What were the challenging / difficult parts of the lab
  (d) The output (retrieved from S3) of your MapReduce run

(2) A file DocAnalyzer.java with the source code for your solution

Extra credit -- up to 5 points added.  Notice some of longest tokens are obviously
a concatenation of several "real" words.  Figure out what's going on, and fix it.
If you do the extra credit, note in your PDF writeup that you did the extra credit,
include in the document the change to the code you made, and give several "before and
after" examples of documents whose longest token improved.
